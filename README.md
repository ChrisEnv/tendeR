# RSS Feed Analytics

## Overview
This project is designed to fetch data from a specified RSS feed over time using an R script. The data is collected daily and committed back to this repository for historical analysis and review.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: This directory stores the output data files, typically CSV files that are generated by the R script.
- **logs/**: (If applicable) Logs generated by the GitHub Actions workflow or the R script.
- **scripts/**:
  - `fetch_data.R`: The R script responsible for fetching data from the RSS feed.
- **.github/workflows/**:
  - `run_and_commit.yml`: The GitHub Actions workflow file that schedules and runs the R script daily and commits the results back to the repository.

## Setup
To run the scripts locally, you will need R installed on your machine along with the following R packages:
- `tidyRSS`
- `tidyverse`
- `lubridate`

You can install these packages using R commands like:
```R
install.packages("tidyRSS")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")
